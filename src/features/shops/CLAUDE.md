# Shops Feature

## Overview

Shops are business entities in Nessi's C2C marketplace, separate from member identity. A member can own or be a member of shops. This feature provides the data layer (types, services, hooks), validations, UI components, and pages for shop management.

## Architecture

- **types/shop.ts** — Database-derived types: `Shop` (from shops Row), `ShopInsert` (Insert minus system fields), `ShopUpdate` (Update minus system fields), `ShopMember` (from shop_members Row with joined `shop_roles` data), `ShopMemberInsert`
- **types/permissions.ts** — Permission model types: `ShopPermissionFeature` (6 feature domains), `ShopPermissionLevel` (`'full' | 'view' | 'none'`), `ShopPermissions` (Record mapping features to levels), `ShopRole` (typed `shop_roles` row with `ShopPermissions` instead of generic `Json`)
- **constants/roles.ts** — System role constants: `SYSTEM_ROLE_IDS` (deterministic UUIDs), `SYSTEM_ROLE_SLUGS`, `DEFAULT_ROLE_ID` (Contributor)
- **utils/check-permission.ts** — Pure permission utility functions: `checkPermission` (returns level, defaults to `'none'`), `hasAccess` (true for `'full'` or `'view'`), `hasFullAccess` (true only for `'full'`), `meetsLevel` (true if user's level >= required level — used by `requireShopPermission` in `src/libs/shop-permissions.ts`)
- **services/shop.ts** — Direct Supabase queries via browser client (RLS handles authorization)
- **services/shop-server.ts** — Server-side Supabase queries via server client (for server components, e.g., public shop page)
- **hooks/use-shops.ts** — Tanstack Query hooks for data fetching and mutations
- **validations/shop.ts** — Zod schemas: `createShopSchema` (name, slug, description) and `updateShopSchema` (partial, all fields optional)

## Avatar Upload API

`POST /api/shops/avatar`

- Requires `requireShopPermission(request, 'shop_settings', 'full')` — validates via `X-Nessi-Context` header
- Accepts `file` (image) + `shopId` in `multipart/form-data`
- Validates MIME type (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/gif`), 5MB limit
- Processes with `sharp`: resizes to 200x200, converts to WebP at 80% quality
- Uses admin client for storage upload (bypasses RLS; ownership verified in handler)
- Stores at `shops/{shopId}/avatar.webp` in the `profile-assets` bucket
- Returns `{ url: string }`

## Hero Banner Upload API

`POST /api/shops/hero-banner`

- Requires `requireShopPermission(request, 'shop_settings', 'full')` — validates via `X-Nessi-Context` header
- Accepts `file` (image) + `shopId` in `multipart/form-data`
- Validates MIME type (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/gif`), 5MB limit
- Processes with `sharp`: resizes to max 1200x400 (fit inside, no upscale), converts to WebP at 85% quality
- Uses admin client for storage upload (bypasses RLS; ownership verified in handler)
- Stores at `shops/{shopId}/hero-banner.webp` in the `profile-assets` bucket
- Returns `{ url: string }`

## Shop Deletion API

`DELETE /api/shops/[id]`

- Requires `requireShopPermission(request, 'shop_settings', 'full', { expectedShopId })` — Owner-only via permission bypass
- Returns 401 (no session), 403 (insufficient permissions), 404 (not found or already soft-deleted)
- Performs best-effort storage cleanup before soft delete:
  - Removes shop assets at `shops/{shopId}/avatar.webp` and hero banner from `profile-assets` bucket
  - Queries shop-owned products → `product_images`, removes files from `listing-images` bucket
- Storage cleanup failures are caught and logged but do not block the soft delete
- Soft-deletes the shop row (`deleted_at = now()`) using the admin client
- Uses `parseStoragePath` helper to extract storage paths from Supabase public URLs
- Pattern mirrors `src/app/api/auth/delete-account/route.ts` (account deletion with storage cleanup)
- Returns `{ success: true }` on 200

## Shared Components Reused

- `InlineEdit` from `@/components/controls/inline-edit`
- `Modal` from `@/components/layout/modal`
- `AvatarUpload` from `@/components/controls/avatar-upload` — accepts configurable `uploadUrl` and `extraFormData` props
- `ImageCropper` from `@/components/controls/image-cropper` — used by `HeroBannerUpload` to let users crop the banner before upload
- `Button` from `@/components/controls/button`
- Toast context from `@/components/indicators/toast/context`

## Key Patterns

- **Direct Supabase access** — Most services use the browser client (`@/libs/supabase/client`) directly, with RLS policies enforcing authorization. Exceptions: `deleteShop()` calls the API route for server-side storage cleanup, and avatar uploads go through `POST /api/shops/avatar` for server-side image processing.
- **Standardized API authorization** — All shop API routes (except `POST /api/shops` for creation) use `requireShopPermission` from `src/libs/shop-permissions.ts` instead of manual `owner_id` checks. Routes with `shopId` in URL params pass `{ expectedShopId }` to prevent privilege escalation. Routes with `shopId` in the request body validate it matches `result.shopId` after the permission check.
- **Database-derived types** — `Shop` type comes from `Database['public']['Tables']['shops']['Row']` and `ShopMember` from `Database['public']['Tables']['shop_members']['Row']`, ensuring type safety with the schema.
- **System-managed fields** — `ShopInsert` and `ShopUpdate` omit fields managed by database triggers or system processes (id, created_at, updated_at, deleted_at).
- **Soft delete** — Shops are soft-deleted via the `deleted_at` column. Queries that list or fetch active shops filter `deleted_at IS NULL`.
- **Slug uniqueness** — Shop slugs are checked for uniqueness against the shared `slugs` table (not just the shops table), since slugs are a cross-entity namespace shared with member slugs. The `generateSlug` utility in `src/features/shared/utils/slug.ts` handles auto-generating a slug from a display name.
- **Avatar upload via API route** — Unlike standard shop CRUD (direct Supabase), avatar uploads go through `POST /api/shops/avatar` for server-side image processing with `sharp`.
- **Server-side deletion with storage cleanup** — Shop deletion uses `DELETE /api/shops/[id]` (server-side API route with admin client) to clean up storage objects before soft-deleting. The `deleteShop()` service function calls this API route via `fetch`. This parallels the account deletion pattern in `src/app/api/auth/delete-account/route.ts`.

## Shop Roles

Shop member roles are stored in the `shop_roles` table with a FK from `shop_members.role_id`. Three system roles are seeded with deterministic UUIDs:

| Role        | UUID                                   | Permissions                                                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Owner       | `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111101` | Full access to all 6 domains                                                      |
| Manager     | `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111102` | Full on listings/pricing/orders/messaging, view on shop_settings, none on members |
| Contributor | `11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111103` | Full on listings only                                                             |

Use `SYSTEM_ROLE_IDS` from `constants/roles.ts` to reference these UUIDs in application code — never hardcode the UUID strings directly. Use `checkPermission`, `hasAccess`, `hasFullAccess`, and `meetsLevel` from `utils/check-permission.ts` to check a member's effective permission level for a feature — never hardcode permission logic for specific roles.

System roles have `shop_id IS NULL` and `is_system = true`. Future custom roles will have a `shop_id` FK to a specific shop. RLS allows all authenticated users to read system roles; custom roles are only visible to members of that shop.

## Server-Side Permission Middleware

API routes that require shop-level authorization use `requireShopPermission` from `src/libs/shop-permissions.ts`. This replaces manual `owner_id` checks with role-based permission checking.

### Usage Pattern

```ts
import { requireShopPermission } from '@/libs/shop-permissions';
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(request: Request, { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  const { id: shopId } = await params;

  const result = await requireShopPermission(request, 'members', 'full', {
    expectedShopId: shopId,
  });
  if (result instanceof NextResponse) return result;

  const { user, shopId: contextShopId, member } = result;
  // ... route logic
}
```

### How It Works

1. Authenticates via server Supabase client (`getUser()`) — returns 401 if no session
2. Parses `X-Nessi-Context` header (format: `shop:{shopId}`) — returns 403 if missing/invalid
3. Validates `expectedShopId` matches the context header shopId (prevents privilege escalation) — returns 403 on mismatch
4. Queries `shop_members` joined with `shop_roles` via admin client (bypasses RLS)
5. Owner bypass: `is_system === true && slug === 'owner'` always passes
6. Permission check: uses `meetsLevel()` to compare user's level against required level

### Key Types

- `ShopPermissionResult` — success return: `{ user, shopId, member }` where `member` includes typed `shop_roles`
- `RequireShopPermissionOptions` — `{ expectedShopId?: string }` for URL param validation
- Return type is `Promise<NextResponse | ShopPermissionResult>` — use `instanceof NextResponse` to discriminate

### Important

- Always pass `{ expectedShopId: shopId }` when the route has a shop ID in the URL params — this prevents a caller from having context for Shop A but operating on Shop B
- The helper is stateless — no caching across requests
- Owner bypass uses the role's `is_system` + `slug` fields, NOT `shops.owner_id`
